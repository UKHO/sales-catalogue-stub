# Contributing to the project

Firstly, thank you for taking the time to contribute! We appreciate it as this is not the most exciting or glamorous of topics.

These are only guidelines for contributing to this repo, not hard rules. They may not fit all scenarios encountered, so please use your best judgment and feel free to propose a change to this document via a pull request if you think it can be improved.

## Questions

If you have any questions, please open an issue.

## Improvements

If you have any improvements (things being poorly worded, misspelt, unclear, tweaks) please make a pull request. During the pull request review we will check to ensure your improvements have not changed the meaning of the guidance.

## Change

If you would like to make changes (disagreements about the current guidance, substantial adding of new guidance) the best approach is to open an issue with the details/ideas so we can discuss the changes before a pull request is made. If no issue is made before a pull request we will still consider it, however there is chance the your effort is wasted if we don't accept your pull request in.
